# Lessons Learned & Retrospective

This document captures insights gained throughout the project lifecycle to improve future projects and processes. It should be updated periodically and especially at project milestones or completion.

## Project Phase: [e.g., Initial Setup / IAM Foundation / CloudTrail Integration]

### What Went Well?
- [Example: The modular Terraform structure allowed for quick iteration on IAM policies.]
- [Example: Clear communication channels with the security team streamlined policy approvals.]

### What Could Be Improved?
- [Example: Initial estimates for setting up cross-account trust policies were too optimistic.]
- [Example: More granular breakdown of tasks for the CloudTrail integration phase would have been beneficial.]

### Actionable Takeaways:
- [Example: For future IAM projects, allocate more time for policy development and testing in isolated environments.]
- [Example: Implement automated checks for S3 bucket policies earlier in the development cycle.]
